# üõí Superstore Sales Analysis & Forecast ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard

Hi there! üëã  
This project is a Power BI dashboard I created to analyze and forecast sales for a fictional superstore. It includes an in-depth look at past sales performance, customer segments, and a simple 15-day sales forecast ‚Äî all powered by a single CSV dataset.

Take a look at my live dashboard here: [View](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/96b7da2c-6464-4877-a0a0-e72bf1db7605/5a04f0bc36d5dab5e7c7?bookmarkGuid=a788dd0f-f76e-40cb-94d3-ac417b5a0571&bookmarkUsage=1&ctid=0b0d0759-1508-48c6-a560-01133e331463&portalSessionId=d3a76e7e-747b-4e21-8f96-31bf0cc032fe&fromEntryPoint=export)

## ü§ù Why I Made This

I built this project to improve my Power BI skills and to practice end-to-end business analysis ‚Äî from data wrangling to visualization and forecasting. Sharing it here in case it helps others doing the same!

## üìå Notes

- Forecasting is based on historical sales using Power BI‚Äôs default time series model.
- This is a static dashboard (no real-time data connection).
