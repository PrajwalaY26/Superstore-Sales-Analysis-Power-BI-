# üõí Superstore Sales Analysis & Forecast ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard

Hi there! üëã  
This project is a Power BI dashboard I created to analyze and forecast sales for a fictional superstore. It includes an in-depth look at past sales performance, customer segments, and a simple 15-day sales forecast ‚Äî all powered by a single CSV dataset.

## üìä What‚Äôs Inside

- **Interactive Dashboard** built in Power BI
- **Sales, Profit, and Quantity Trends** broken down by:
  - Category & Sub-Category
  - Region
  - Customer Segment
  - Time (Year, Quarter, Month)
- **Top-performing Products** and loss-leaders identified
- **15-Day Sales Forecast** using Power BI‚Äôs built-in forecasting tools

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used is a popular sample CSV (Superstore Sales data) containing:
- Orders from various U.S. regions
- Product, category, and customer information
- Sales, profit, discount, and shipping data
- Dates from 2014 to 2017

> The data is fictional and often used for practice or demonstration purposes.

## Key Insights

- Profits vary widely across categories and regions.
- Discounts have a noticeable impact on profitability.
- Forecasting shows short-term sales trends based on historical data.

## Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for calculated measures and KPIs
- **CSV File** as data source

## Getting Started

To explore the dashboard:
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop (I just shared the snapshots of the dashboard bcz unfortunately I am not able to genererate the embedded code for my report)
3. (Optional) Load the CSV if prompted and refresh the model

## ü§ù Why I Made This

I built this project to improve my Power BI skills and to practice end-to-end business analysis ‚Äî from data wrangling to visualization and forecasting. Sharing it here in case it helps others doing the same!

## üìå Notes

- Forecasting is based on historical sales using Power BI‚Äôs default time series model.
- This is a static dashboard (no real-time data connection).
